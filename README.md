Create a movie search engine using the [OMBd API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and AMP components.

http://www.omdbapi.com/

The [AMP Documentation](https://amp.dev/) is a great resource.  In addition to any of the "getting started" tutorials, we recommend reviewing [amp-list](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-list/), [amp-img](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-img/), [amp-bind](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-bind/), [AMP Actions & Events](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/learn/amp-actions-and-events/)


## Requirements
* Provide your solution as a single HTML file that passes the [AMP Validator](https://validator.ampproject.org/)
* Include a text input that refreshes the dynamic content as the user types
* Include an amp-list, amp-img, and demonstrate usage of amp-bind and event handling
* At minimum, display the movie title and cover image
* Apply some basic CSS to the page

The canonical link should point to itself `<link rel="canonical" href="self.html">`
